# 🧩 Palindrome Number (Easy)

## Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
x = 121  
**Output:**  
true  
**Explanation:**  
121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
x = -121  
**Output:**  
false  
**Explanation:**  
From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
x = 10  
**Output:**  
false  
**Explanation:**  
Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints

- -2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1

## Follow-up

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
