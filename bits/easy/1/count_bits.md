# 🧮 Count Bits

Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`.

### 🧪 Example 1
**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `[0,1,1]`  
**Explanation:**  
```
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

---

### 🧪 Example 2
**Input:** `n = 5`  
**Output:** `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`  
**Explanation:**  
```
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

---

### 🔒 Constraints
- `0 <= n <= 10^5`

---

### 🔍 Follow-up
- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?
