# Longest Word - Easy

Have the function `LongestWord(sen)` take the `sen` parameter being passed and return the **longest word** in the string.

If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the **first word** from the string with that length.

Ignore punctuation and assume `sen` will not be empty.  
Words may also contain numbers.

### 🧪 Example:
**Input:**  
`sen = "Hello world123 567"`  
**Output:**  
`"world123"`

### 📝 Notes:
- Words are separated by spaces.
- Strip punctuation like `!`, `.`, `?`, etc.
- Numbers within words are allowed (e.g., `"abc123"` is valid).
