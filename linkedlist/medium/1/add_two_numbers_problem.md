# âž• Coding Challenge: Add Two Numbers (Linked List)

## Level
Medium

## Category
Linked List / Math

## Problem Statement
You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers.  
The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.  
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, **except the number 0 itself**.

### Function Signature
```go
func AddTwoNumbers(l1 *ListNode, l2 *ListNode) *ListNode
```
Where `ListNode` is defined as:
```go
type ListNode struct {
    Val  int
    Next *ListNode
}
```

## Example 1
### Input
```
l1 = [2, 4, 3]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]
```

### Output
```
[7, 0, 8]
```
### Explanation
342 + 465 = 807 (reverse order is [7, 0, 8]).

## Example 2
### Input
```
l1 = [0]
l2 = [0]
```

### Output
```
[0]
```

## Example 3
### Input
```
l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]
l2 = [9,9,9,9]
```

### Output
```
[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.Val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
